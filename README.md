# assignment1

I have choosen this topic because i find it very interesting also because when i bought my first phone that was iphone 5 and i love to use this phone because i like the designes, colours moreover i like the security of the iphone that in case if it is lost so no one can access it without anypassword now there are many models in the market so with different features.

I have used Html and Css coding, i use background color for my website and Fonts too.


Further, i do four commits step by step.
